<hr>

[mica](https://mica.one/) is a beautiful, extensible and smart calculator/toolkit capable of processing human readable input such as `101F to C` as well as standard input such as `9x10`.

### roadmap & future plans
mica is heavily under development and is currently in stage `Base Development`, while I can't exactly reveal how I'd like mica to end up like, here's a general roadmap for you to follow.

- [ ]  Initial implementation of the application
- [ ]  A website to showcase the app
- [ ]  Perform Standard Calculations 
- [ ]  Perform Conversions `*RELEASE MARK`
- [ ]  Process human-readable input
- [ ]  The ability to process paragraphs such as `Convert 10F to C`
- [ ]  Publish on the Apple App Store
- [ ]  Third party plugins support

### documentation
mica is extensible and plugins can be loaded alongside the main app for additional features.
the documentation of it and the entire app will be posted [here](https://docs.mica.one) as soon as it's available.
